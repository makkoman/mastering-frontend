# JS Challenge

The objective of this challenge is to make interactive the blocg section of the page.

## Constrains
- You should have clean and working code that can be reviewed in a PR without asking to much questions
- Just use [Vanilla JS](http://vanilla-js.com/), this means no jquery, react, vue, etc

## Instructions
- Set a spinner to be shown when loading content
  - You can use any spinner for example https://github.com/fareco/css-loader
- If JS is turned off you should show a warning like "**For full functionality of this site it is necessary to enable JavaScript.**"
- Load posts from https://wt-4662f45b9eefda7172b747b28d23efdb-0.sandbox.auth0-extend.com/blog
- Fill the data inside the blog section of the page

- Create a carousel interaction similar to this one, except for animations https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/tryit.asp?filename=trybs_ref_js_carousel2&stacked=h

- Remember don't use frameworks or libraries

## Extra points
Do this if you want more challenges
- Remove the blog section entirely when JS is turned off
- Animate the carousel (you can use animation libraries or CSS transitions)
- Make it work in all devices (touch enabled)
- Create the interaction for the FAQ section
- Animate the logos section
- Create the carousel for the clients quotes section
